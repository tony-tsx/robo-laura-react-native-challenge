## Comments

> One of the flaws I made in this project was not starting it with theme or style management like styled-components or react-native-paper. So I had to create a lot of styles over and over again. A mistake I would correct in the first refactoring I had the chance to do. 

> Although I'm pretty sure that one of the skills that would be interesting to present in the project would be the use of reduxjs, but it's really a very small project with no big changes in state so I thought it was unnecessary, and I saved the time of writing reducers or sagas. 

> To be quite honest it was the first time I used automated tests in react, I believe that with time I can write better and more practical tests.
